Idk if agent Marcus had updated you about the brain containers, but apparently there's a limit in the range - up to 200 miles - with the version we got. Obv we're getting the short end of the stick here with the deal, but I assume DG got some plans to deal with it later down the line. For now, proceed with the set-up clean-up as usual.    And contact D-cell when you can; you're their in with the database, dude.    - YKMG "
