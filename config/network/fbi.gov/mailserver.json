Idk if agent Marcus has updated you about the brain containers, but R&D finally found a hard limit wrt the range: up to 200 miles with the one we got. Obv we're getting the short end of the stick here, but I assume DG got some plans to clean up the deal later down the line. For now, proceed with the set-up clean-up as usual.    P/s: contact D-cell when you can; they need a temp agent.    - YKMG "

Seemed to have eaten a few passerbys; lots of vacationing hunters this time of year ig. We managed to free the half digested corpses if nothing else (burning the mf works as usual) but it fled before we could do anymore more damage. Chances are it's being raised by [REDACTED] so it's not like we could do much anyway.    Just wanted to give you a head's up in case you get sent to do field work.    - YKMG"
