They moved the local from Nome to a ghost town like, 50 sth miles east there instead (towns called Bluff - I cant find anything about it so chances are you wont as well, but as usual, Im prepared to be surprised) so you dont need to worry about whatever situation there you were trying to avoid there.    Anyway, I heard that Francis is going as well so you know :)    Get back to me asap, looking forward to our joint experiment on Thursday!"
